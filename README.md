#### *Raising awareness towards more efficient practices of biological big data computation with new (cloud?) technologies*

## What is the problem?

The lack of knowledge of how High Performance Computing (HPC) works for biological researchers leads to poor experimental design in informatics research. Designing experiments without optimization and scalability in mind leads to economic losses (department) and time losses (researcher).

### The strategy

Our design strategy to build our framework is devided into phases.

**Phase (sub-project) 1**: analyzing the core issues and develop one or two case studies. 

* ***Develop persona(s)***. The persona can be useful to find appropriate target audience with wider perspectives (to prevent biasing from our own perspective). 

* ***Develop and distribute a survey***. This could serve as the guidlines to both develop personas and case studies.

* ***Design case studies***. 

**Phase (sub-project) 2**: develop workshop to promote the ideas.

* Develop presentation slides.

**Phase (sub-project) 3**: implement the framework.

**Phase (sub-project) 4**: build a community.
