# eBioNT

#### *A framework for more efficient biocomputing with new (cloud?) technologies* 

***

## Why do we need this?

### The problem

Current practices in Biocomputing largely overlook resource optimization. This leads to lack of computational efficiency that results in waste of resources. This problem will accumulate to a major impact on bioinformatics workflow, and will ultimately compromise the sustainability of bio-science research.

### The strategy

Our design strategy to build our framework is devided into phases.

**Phase (sub-project) 1**: analyzing the core issues and develop one or two case studies. 

**Phase (sub-project) 2**: develop workshop to promote the ideas.

**Phase (sub-project) 3**: implement the framework.

**Phase (sub-project) 4**: build a community.
