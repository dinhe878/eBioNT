# eBioNT - a workshop
Current practices in Biocomputing largely overlook resource optimization. This leads to lack of computational efficiency that results in waste of resources. This problem will accumulate to a major impact on bioinformatics workflow, and will ultimately compromise the sustainability of bio-science research.

First step towards this gail, we want to develop a workshop to promote a more efficient bio-computing with new (cloud) technologies.
